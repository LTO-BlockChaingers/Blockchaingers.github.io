2. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png).

3. You can check your code against the guidelines using Better Code Hub, a GitHub integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub CI and can run at Pull Requests and Pushes.

4. 16 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum codebase size 200 KLoc.
