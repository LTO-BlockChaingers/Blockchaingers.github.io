# Code quality matters during Blockchaingers Hackathon!

When: 5 - 8 April 2018.

Where: Sugarfactory, Groningen NL

[Website:](https://blockchaingers.org)




## How your code is evaluated

1. Your code will be evaluated against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. The guidelines are described in full in [“Building Maintainable Software”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) (get your free copy during the event)

2. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

3. You can check your code against the guidelines using Better Code Hub, a [GitHub.com](https://Github.com) integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub Flow and can run at Pull Requests and Commits.

4. 16 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum codebase size 200 KLoc


## How to get started

1. Mail your team name and personal GitHub handles to the BlockChaingers.

2. Your team will be added to this [Organization](https://github.com/blockchaingers)

3. Go to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com)
